Each time sine is called recursively, the angle is divided by 3 if it's less than 0.1, and this is repeated until the angle is 
less than 0.1. 

Dividing 12.15 by 3 five times gives us

```
(/ (/ (/ (/ (/ 12.15 3)
            3)
         3)
      3)
   3)
0.05
```
As p is only called each time we need to divide by 3, then p is called 5 times.

The sine procedure is actually called 6 times - 5 times recurisvely with p, and once at the beginning

It's not too onerous to expand this out, so to double check...

```
(sine 12.15)

(p (sine (/ 12.15 3)))
(p (sine (4.05)))

(p (p (sine (/ 4.05 3))))
(p (p (sine (1.35))))

(p (p (p (sine (/ 1.35 3)))))
(p (p (p (sine (0.35)))))

(p (p (p (p sine (/ 0.35 3))))))
(p (p (p (p sine (0.15))))))

(p (p (p (p (p (sine (/ 0.15 3)))))))
(p (p (p (p (p (sine (0.05)))))))
(p (p (p (p (p (0.05))))))
```

The order of growth in space is a function of how many times the angle n needs to be divided by 3 to be less than 0.1. Or to put
it another way, an extra processing step, and record on the stack is required each time the angle triples.

I need to brush up on my big O theory, but this is apparently theta (log n) to the base 3.
