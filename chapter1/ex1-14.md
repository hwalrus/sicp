So, 4 different combinations of coins.

In terms of growth of the space required, the max depth of the tree is always n (as our minimum coin denomination is 1). This means that the order of growth of space is theta (n) as the space requirement is in remembering the height of the stack.

For the number of steps, there's no significant change in the shape until the amount becomes a multiple of another coin. I.e. the number of combinations to change 11, 12, 13, and 14 are all 4. When we change 15, then there's another tree for processing the extra coin e.g. a 5c coin. It looks like the space roughly doubles each time the amount increases by 5+1. So the order of growth of the number of steps is theta (n squared).

It looks like the time complexity is based on the number of coin denominations, so that for 2 coins, it's n squared, for 3 types, it's n cubed, and so on.
