I decided to pick up SICP once again and make a brave attempt to actually do the exercises, and possibly learn some schemey goodness along the way.

I found that there didn't seem to be a sensible scheme interpreter around, so I'm using Dr Racket which seems pretty good (hence the `#lang racket` at the start of each file).
